Late Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to late blight, such as 'Defiant' or 'Mountain Magic.'
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen buildup in the soil.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and any infected fruit to limit the spread of the disease.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., mefenoxam, chlorothalonil) preventively and at the first signs of infection, following local guidelines.
5. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Be vigilant during cool, moist weather that favors late blight development, and scout plants regularly for symptoms.
