Black Rot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select grape varieties that are resistant to black rot, such as 'Concord' or 'Chardonnay.'
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected fruit, leaves, and debris to reduce the source of spores.
3. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., myclobutanil, sulfur) at bloom and during early fruit development.
4. Proper Pruning: Prune vines to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage and fruit.
5. Irrigation Management: Avoid overhead watering to keep leaves dry and minimize humidity.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Watch for warm, humid weather that can promote black rot development.
