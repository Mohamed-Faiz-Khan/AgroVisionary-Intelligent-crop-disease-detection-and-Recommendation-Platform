Healthy Strawberry Crops:
1. Soil: Prefer well-drained, sandy loam soil rich in organic matter with a pH of 5.5-6.5.
2. Water: Maintain consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting; avoid overhead watering to reduce disease risk.
3. Fertilization: Apply balanced fertilizers high in potassium and phosphorus, based on soil tests, particularly during planting and fruiting.
4. Pest/Disease Control: Monitor for pests like spider mites and diseases such as powdery mildew; implement integrated pest management strategies.
5. Mulching: Use mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and protect fruit from soilborne diseases.
6. Spacing: Space plants adequately (12-18 inches apart) to allow for good airflow and sunlight exposure.
7. Pruning: Remove dead or damaged leaves and runners to promote healthier growth.
8. Variety Selection: Choose disease-resistant varieties suited for your climate and intended use (fresh market, preserves, or processing).
