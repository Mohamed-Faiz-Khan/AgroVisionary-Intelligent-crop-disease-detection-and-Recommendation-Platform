Tomato Mosaic Virus Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to mosaic viruses.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plants to limit the spread of the virus and prevent secondary infections.
3. Proper Tool Hygiene: Clean and disinfect tools, stakes, and equipment regularly to prevent the transmission of the virus.
4. Limit Mechanical Damage: Avoid injuring plants, as wounds can serve as entry points for the virus.
5. Control Insect Vectors: Implement integrated pest management (IPM) to control aphids and other insect vectors that can spread the virus.
6. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to help reduce the virus's presence in the soil.
