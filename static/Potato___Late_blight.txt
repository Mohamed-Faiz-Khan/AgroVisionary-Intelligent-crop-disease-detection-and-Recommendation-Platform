Late Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select potato varieties that have resistance to late blight, such as 'Katahdin' or 'Atlantic.'
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle and reduce the buildup of pathogens.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and cull any infected tubers to limit spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., mefenoxam, chlorothalonil) preventively and at the first signs of infection, following local guidelines.
5. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Be vigilant during wet, cool conditions that favor late blight development, and scout fields regularly for symptoms.
