Healthy Peach Crops:
1. Soil: Prefer well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0.
2. Water: Ensure consistent moisture, especially during fruit development; avoid waterlogging.
3. Fertilization: Use balanced fertilizers based on soil tests, focusing on nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
4. Pest/Disease Control: Monitor for pests like peach tree borers and diseases such as brown rot; implement integrated pest management.
5. Pruning: Prune annually to improve air circulation, remove dead or diseased branches, and encourage new growth.
6. Mulching: Apply mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
7. Spacing: Space trees adequately to promote good airflow and sunlight exposure.
8. Variety Selection: Choose disease-resistant varieties suited for your climate and intended use (freestone or clingstone).
