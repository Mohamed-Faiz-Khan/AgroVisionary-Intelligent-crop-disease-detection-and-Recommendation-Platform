Cedar Apple Rust Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select resistant apple varieties like 'Liberty' or 'Enterprise.'
2. Sanitation: Remove fallen leaves and fruit to minimize spore sources.
3. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., myclobutanil, captan) during bloom and early fruit development.
4. Control Alternate Hosts: Remove or manage nearby cedar (juniper) trees, which are alternate hosts for the rust fungus.
5. Regular Inspections: Check for symptoms, such as yellow-orange spots on leaves and galls on cedar trees.
