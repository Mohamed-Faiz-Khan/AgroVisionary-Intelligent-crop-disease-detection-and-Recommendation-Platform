Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to TYLCV, if available.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plants to limit the spread of the virus.
3. Control Insect Vectors: Implement integrated pest management (IPM) to control whiteflies, the primary vectors of TYLCV. Use insecticides or introduce natural predators.
4. Proper Tool Hygiene: Clean and disinfect tools and equipment to prevent the transmission of the virus.
5. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to help reduce the virus's presence in the soil.
6. Monitor and Manage Weeds: Control weeds that may host the virus or its vectors, reducing potential sources of infection.
