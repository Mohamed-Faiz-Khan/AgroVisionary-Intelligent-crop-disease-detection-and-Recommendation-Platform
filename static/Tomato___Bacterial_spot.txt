Bacterial Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to bacterial spot, such as 'Celebrity' or 'BHN 602.'
1. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and avoid working in wet fields to minimize disease spread.
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
3. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to promote air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
4. Fungicide Applications: Use bactericides (e.g., copper-based products) at the first signs of infection and during periods of high risk.
5. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Keep an eye on wet and humid conditions that favor bacterial growth and adjust management practices accordingly.
