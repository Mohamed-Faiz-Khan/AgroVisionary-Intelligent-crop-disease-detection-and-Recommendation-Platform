Powdery Mildew Management 
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select cherry varieties that are resistant to powdery mildew.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit to reduce the spread of spores.
3. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., sulfur, myclobutanil) during early symptoms and at bud break.
4. Proper Pruning: Prune trees to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
5. Avoid Overhead Watering: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and minimize humidity.
6. Monitor Conditions: Check for high humidity and temperature, which can favor powdery mildew development.
