Leaf Mold Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to leaf mold.
2. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris to minimize spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., copper-based products) at the first signs of infection and follow local guidelines for timing and frequency.
5. Water Management: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and avoid overhead watering.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Be aware of high humidity and cool temperatures that favor leaf mold development, and adjust management practices accordingly.
