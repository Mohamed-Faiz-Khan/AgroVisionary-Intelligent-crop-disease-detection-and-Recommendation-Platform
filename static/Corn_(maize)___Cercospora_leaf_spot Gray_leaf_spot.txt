Cercospora Leaf Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Hybrids: Select corn hybrids that are resistant to Cercospora leaf spot.
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected crop residues to reduce spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., azoxystrobin, propiconazole) during early symptoms or at tasseling.
5. Optimize Planting Practices: Space plants properly to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Watch for high humidity and wet conditions that favor disease development.
