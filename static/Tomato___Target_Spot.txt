Target Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that show resistance to target spot.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris to limit the spread of the pathogen.
3. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of pathogens in the soil.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin) at the first signs of infection or preventively during wet weather.
5. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Be vigilant during warm, humid conditions that favor target spot development and scout plants regularly for symptoms.
