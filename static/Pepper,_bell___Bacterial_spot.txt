Bacterial Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select bell pepper varieties that are resistant to bacterial spot, such as 'King Arthur' or 'Sunset.'
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and avoid working in wet fields to reduce disease spread.
3. Crop Rotation: Rotate crops to non-host plants to break the disease cycle.
4. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to promote air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
5. Fungicide Applications: Use bactericides (e.g., copper-based products) at the first signs of infection and during periods of high risk.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Keep an eye on wet and humid conditions that favor bacterial growth and adjust management practices accordingly.
