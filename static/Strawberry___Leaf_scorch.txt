Leaf Scorch Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select strawberry varieties that show some resistance to leaf scorch.
2. Proper Watering: Ensure consistent watering to avoid drought stress, which can contribute to leaf scorch.
3. Mulching: Use mulch to retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
4. Fertilization: Apply balanced fertilizers to support healthy growth and reduce stress on plants.
5. Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and reduce humidity around plants.
6. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Be aware of extreme heat and drought conditions, and take steps to protect plants during stressful weather.
