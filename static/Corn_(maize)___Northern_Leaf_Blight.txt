Northern Leaf Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Hybrids: Select corn hybrids that are resistant to Northern Leaf Blight.
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of the pathogen in the soil.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant residues after harvest to limit spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin) during early infection or at the tasseling stage.
5. Proper Plant Spacing: Space plants adequately to enhance air circulation and minimize humidity around the leaves.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Be aware of warm, humid conditions that favor the development of the disease.
