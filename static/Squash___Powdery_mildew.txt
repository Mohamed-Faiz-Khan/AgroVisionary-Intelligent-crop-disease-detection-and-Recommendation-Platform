Powdery Mildew Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select squash varieties that are resistant to powdery mildew, such as 'Table Queen' or 'Butternut.'
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris to reduce spore sources.
3. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., sulfur, myclobutanil) at the first signs of infection and continue as needed.
5. Water Management: Use drip irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and avoid overhead watering.
6. Regular Monitoring: Inspect plants regularly for early signs of powdery mildew and take action promptly if symptoms appear.
