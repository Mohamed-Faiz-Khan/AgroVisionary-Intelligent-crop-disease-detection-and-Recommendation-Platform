Esca Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select grape varieties that have some resistance to Esca.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected vines and wood to reduce the spread of the disease.
3. Proper Pruning: Prune vines to enhance air circulation and sunlight exposure, which can help reduce humidity.
4. Water Management: Avoid excessive irrigation and ensure proper drainage to prevent stress on vines.
5. Avoid Wounding Vines: Minimize mechanical injuries during vineyard management, as wounds can serve as entry points for the pathogen.
6. Monitor Vines: Regularly inspect vines for symptoms such as leaf discoloration and vine dieback.
