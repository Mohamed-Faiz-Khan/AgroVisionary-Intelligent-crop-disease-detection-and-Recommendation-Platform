Common Rust Management
1. Choose Resistant Hybrids: Select corn hybrids that have resistance to common rust.
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to reduce disease pressure.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected crop residues after harvest to minimize spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin) at early signs of infection or during the tasseling stage.
5. Proper Plant Spacing: Ensure adequate spacing for better air circulation and reduced humidity.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Keep an eye on warm, humid conditions that favor rust development.
