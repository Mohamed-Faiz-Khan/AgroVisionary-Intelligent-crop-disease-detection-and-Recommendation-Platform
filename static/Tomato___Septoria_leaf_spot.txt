Septoria Leaf Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to Septoria leaf spot.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves, plant debris, and any volunteer plants to minimize spore sources.
3. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to break the disease cycle and reduce pathogen buildup in the soil.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin) at the first signs of infection or preventively.
5. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Be vigilant during warm, humid conditions that favor Septoria development and scout plants regularly for symptoms.
