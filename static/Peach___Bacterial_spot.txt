Bacterial Spot Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select peach varieties that are resistant to bacterial spot, such as 'TropicBeauty' or 'Flameprince.'
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves, fruit, and debris to minimize the spread of bacteria.
3. Proper Pruning: Prune trees to improve air circulation and sunlight exposure, which helps reduce humidity.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply appropriate fungicides (e.g., copper-based products) during bloom and as needed.
5. Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and minimize leaf wetness, which promotes bacterial growth.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Watch for wet, warm conditions that favor bacterial development and adjust management practices accordingly.
