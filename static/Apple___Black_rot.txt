Black Rot Management Summary
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select apple varieties resistant to black rot, such as 'Enterprise' or 'Liberty.'
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected fruit and leaves to reduce spore sources.
3. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., myclobutanil, captan) during bloom and early fruit development.
4. Proper Pruning: Prune to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the fruit.
5. Monitor Environmental Conditions: Keep an eye on wet weather, which promotes black rot development.
6. Regular Inspections: Check for early symptoms, such as dark, sunken spots on fruit.
