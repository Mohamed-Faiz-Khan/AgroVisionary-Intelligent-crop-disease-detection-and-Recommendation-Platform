Early Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select tomato varieties that are resistant to early blight, such as 'Celebrity' or 'Mountain Fresh.'
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of the pathogen in the soil.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and any volunteer tomato plants to minimize spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin) preventively and at the first signs of infection.
5. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Be vigilant during warm, humid conditions that favor early blight development and scout plants regularly for symptoms.
