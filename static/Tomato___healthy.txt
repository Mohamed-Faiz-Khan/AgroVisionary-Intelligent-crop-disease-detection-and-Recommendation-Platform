Healthy Tomato Crops:
1. Soil: Prefer well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter with a pH of 6.0-6.8.
2. Water: Maintain consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development; avoid overhead watering to reduce disease risk.
3. Fertilization: Apply balanced fertilizers, focusing on phosphorus and potassium during flowering and fruiting.
4. Pest/Disease Control: Monitor for pests like aphids and diseases such as blight; implement integrated pest management strategies.
5. Pruning: Prune lower leaves and suckers to improve airflow and sunlight exposure.
6. Support: Use stakes or cages to support plants and keep fruit off the ground.
7. Mulching: Apply mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
8. Spacing: Space plants adequately (18-24 inches apart) to ensure good airflow and reduce disease risk.
9. Variety Selection: Choose disease-resistant varieties suited for your climate and intended use (fresh market, cooking, or sauces).
