Two-Spotted Spider Mite Management 
1. Monitoring: Regularly inspect plants for signs of spider mite infestation, such as stippling on leaves and webbing.
2. Proper Watering: Maintain consistent watering to keep plants healthy, as stressed plants are more susceptible to infestation.
3. Sanitation: Remove infested leaves and debris to reduce the population and prevent further spread.
4. Biological Control: Introduce natural predators like ladybugs or predatory mites to help control spider mite populations.
5. Insecticidal Soap: Apply insecticidal soap or horticultural oils to infested areas, ensuring thorough coverage of the undersides of leaves.
6. Avoid Overhead Watering: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry and discourage mite populations, as they thrive in hot, dry conditions.
