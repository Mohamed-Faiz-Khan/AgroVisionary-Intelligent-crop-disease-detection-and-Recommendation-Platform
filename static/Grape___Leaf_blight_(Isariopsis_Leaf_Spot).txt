Leaf Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select grape varieties that show some resistance to leaf blight.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected leaves and debris to reduce the source of spores.
3. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, myclobutanil) during bud break and when new growth appears.
4. Proper Pruning: Prune vines to improve air circulation and light penetration, reducing humidity around the foliage.
5. Irrigation Management: Use drip irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and prevent disease spread.
6. Regular Monitoring: Inspect vines regularly for early signs of leaf spots and take action promptly if symptoms appear.
