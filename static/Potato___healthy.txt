Healthy Potato Crops:
1. Soil: Prefer well-drained, loose, loamy soil with a pH of 5.5-6.5.
2. Water: Maintain consistent moisture, especially during tuber development; avoid waterlogging.
3. Fertilization: Apply balanced fertilizers with a focus on phosphorus and potassium; avoid excessive nitrogen.
4. Pest/Disease Control: Monitor for pests like Colorado potato beetles and diseases such as late blight; implement integrated pest management.
5. Hilling: Hill soil around the base of plants to promote tuber growth and prevent greening.
6. Crop Rotation: Practice crop rotation to reduce disease buildup in the soil.
7. Spacing: Space seed potatoes adequately (12-15 inches apart) to allow for proper growth.
8. Variety Selection: Choose disease-resistant varieties suited for your climate and desired use (fresh market or processing).
