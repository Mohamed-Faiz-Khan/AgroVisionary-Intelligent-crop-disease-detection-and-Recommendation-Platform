Early Blight Management
1. Choose Resistant Varieties: Select potato varieties that are resistant to early blight, such as 'Yukon Gold' or 'Kennebec.'
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of the pathogen in the soil.
3. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize spore sources.
4. Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin) at the first signs of infection or preventively during the growing season.
5. Proper Spacing: Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.
6. Monitor Weather Conditions: Watch for warm, humid conditions that favor the development of early blight.
