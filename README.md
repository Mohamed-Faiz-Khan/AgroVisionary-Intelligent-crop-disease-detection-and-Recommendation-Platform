Agriculture is vital to the global economy, with increasing demands for food 
production due to population growth. Precision agriculture, which leverages technology to 
enhance crop yields, has made significant strides, yet challenges like accurate crop 
recommendations and early disease detection persist. These issues present opportunities for 
innovative solutions. The AgroVisionary: Intelligent Crop Disease Detection and 
Recommendation Platform aims to address these challenges by using Random Forest for crop 
recommendation and deep learning for disease detection, providing a reliable, user-friendly 
solution. 
The AgroVisionary platform's goal is to improve agricultural decision-making 
through intelligent recommendations and early disease detection. It uses the Random Forest 
algorithm to analyze environmental data for crop suggestions and a Convolutional Neural 
Network for identifying crop diseases from images. The project employs tools like Flask for 
backend development and TensorFlow for model implementation, assuming accurate data 
availability. The process involved data collection, model training, integration, and extensive 
testing. 
The platform has proven effective, with the crop recommendation system 
achieving 99.31% accuracy and the disease detection model reaching 88.28% accuracy. 
These results demonstrate the system's reliability and efficiency in supporting farmers with 
precise crop recommendations and early disease identification. The platform's user-friendly 
design and responsiveness further enhance its value in promoting sustainable agriculture.


To run this platform we need to run the file of app.py in any code editor(ex. vs code).
The datasete for crop disease detection is plantvillage dataset. It has images. It has about 38 disease and 13 crops respectively. The size is around 54,305 images in color. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
The dataset for crop disease detection is Crop_recommendation dataset. It is a CSV File. It haas about 22 crops in the dataset. The size is about 2200 overall, (100 for each crop). The dataset is in the above files.
